                Happy Valentine's Day! Although I'm about halfway across the world I hope we can still make this day
                special and celebrate our love. Being this far away just means that we get 13 more hours to celebrate
                than everyone else :D.
                <br>
                I still remember 364 days ago when you sent that first message and how truly surprised I was. The amount
                of courage it must have took for you to do that is incredible and I'm so glad you did. My emotions were
                soaring that day and ever since my life has never been better.
                Today, along with many other experiences is another first that I'm excited to share with you. My first
                Valentine's Day with a girlfriend. Today's a special day where I get to express the level of love I have
                for you and how grateful I am to have you in my life. But unfortunately nothing will ever even come
                close to be able to express the level of love I have for you. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect
                person and a more perfect match. You are the perfect amount of agressiveness to match my passiveness,
                the perfect amount of freak, the perfect amount of racism, the perfect amount of decisiveness, and much
                more that perfectly match me. And not only do you have a perfect personanilty, you're also a beautiful
                human. Super attractive(and sexy) and the most pretty girl in my eyes. I love the way you care about me
                and the incredible amount of empathy you have makes me feel soo loved all the time. I know I'm not the
                best at expressing my feelings but I want you to know that I love you more than words can say. You're
                the most special person in my life and I'm so grateful to have you in my life. I can't wait to see you
                again and celebrate our love in person.
                <br><br>
                Love,<br>
